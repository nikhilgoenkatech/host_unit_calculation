There are four files in the package:
 - install_dependencies.txt
   ========================
   Install the dependencies and required libraries by running the file as "source install_dependencies.txt"
 
 - config.json
   ===========
   tenant-details:
     tenant-URL: The tenant URL which will be used to fire the API call
     API-token: The API token which will be used to fire the API
     tenant-name: The tenant name 
   NOTE: If you have multiple tenants to be monitored, add another section

   log_file:

- host_units_calc.py:
  ================
   It is a python script that will make API calls to collect information about the hosts. 
   An excel file "Consumption_details.xlsx" will be generated with the details of host utilization with the following columns:
   1. Host Name: Name of the host.
   2. Client Name: The script would look for tag "ClientName" and populate the name of client in "Client Name" column. Should the tag not available, it would mention "Not found!" in the column against the host.
   3. Host Units: Host Units consumed by that host.

How to run the script:
You can schedule the script to execute every day of the month by using a crontab entry as below:
0 0 1 * * <my_dir>/host_units_calc.py > host_unit_dynatrace_log.out

- constant_host_unit.py
  ====================
  Constant file that is used in the script 

Attached is a sample excel generated by the script. Each excel would contain a worksheet as the tenant-name alongwith the tenant consumption details.
